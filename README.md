# Solarsystem-Calendar-2D
A small Java program which shows the planet's position relative to each other (not quite working for Saturn).

The idea behind the program is to show the planets' position in 2D, as seen from above the north pole.
When the program starts it should get the date and calculate the positions of the planets.

I've included a datepicker so the user may choose a date so that he/she may see how the planets are located.
